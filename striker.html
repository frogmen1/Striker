                                <p>Striker is a very simple man but also very psychotic. He caught the users attention on a Teamspeak 3 VOIP server application sometime around 2018 when the server was full of manytrolls, drug addicts, drunks, toxic arabs, and in the worst cases creepy pedo users.</p>
                                
                                <p> As easily influenced as he is, then again he is psychotic, he really enjoys my company over the years as I naturally listen to his ramblings about mathematics, sciences, terrible psychologist misdiagnosing him (presumed to be schizophrenic), his want for sex change surgery to better his chances of becoming an adult (he's 28 years old), and his love of going to other servers to speak german (It's just him yelling in english or interrupting native German's conversations with his non-linguistic babble: "ishchenka dushken washchengin huschendier wosenbending" for an example).</p>
                                
                                <p>I must tell you Striker has many names on the server (Daniel, Danielle, Striker Daniel, Daniel Striker, Strikester, Amanda, Candice, Danster) but what ever names may be thrown at him he is oppositionally defiant in ignoring the haters request for silence, he just charges through them all with relentless rants about his own theorys of time and disfluencies in the thoughts of others language that doesn't align with his current views on reality.</p>
                                
                                <p>His favorite energy drinks are actually "all the juice flavors none of the stale, watered down, no calorie flavors". He often buys his energy drinks with his government issued payments that was awarded to him (date unknown. income is.) for an insufferable illness that was placed upon him from unknown circumstances. Though many have asked of his past wanting to know how he became the way he is with his silly antics, 
                                    long rants about gender reproduction surgery to change his age, or how hackers are ddosing him on a daily basis with 25 ms (ping) while connected to the server. The answer is we really dont know! I've always been curious about his past but it seems to be rooted in bad memories since he grows quiet about the topic when it comes up.</p>
                                
                                <p>Cigarettes seem like less of a favorite for Striker Daniel and more of an addiction or terrible habit he has. Owning a JUUL as well as more than one pack of cigarettes to feed his, what I presume to be well 
                                over cooked, lungs. It's often worrying for the viewer to watch this man as he chains smokes about two packs a day from a weekly bought carton of Marlboro Reds. Just from that image alone you can see the impactive worrying coming from the users 
                                as they watch him on jumpin.chat, a cam website for Teamspeak users (mostly drunks and NEETS) to gather their faces.</p>
                                
                                <p>Now that you're updated on his likings lets dive into some of the reasons he's been so well liked by the user's of this Teamspeak 3 VOIP sever (though not by everyone sadly). 
                                    Firstly, striker is Amanda! Quite literally an embodiement of a female user liked by the user's of the server (though not by everyone sadly). 
                                    He came to this realization that he was a 28 year old man trapped in a teenager's body, mind, and conscience around the first few months he met her. 
                                    It was somewhat of an overbearing epiphany which could not be shaken from the mans mind having to have stalk the womans social medias so he could do everything just like her as well as get online temporary reproductive surgery to match her, very, glaring looks. Knowing Striker could be such a goofball, as he usally is, I decided to pick up the "knife" for him to see where this adventure would take me. The first time I was requested to do the surgery through my keyboard was in his own words "it was a success! I can feel her boobs on my body. 
                                    I know I am Amanda" which to my mind was quiet odd but funny nonetheless. He didn't even come up with method himself, rather he wanted me to just "do your [the writer] magic" so I convinced him that if I typed through command prompt I could connect to his router which would let me into his camera (he liked to take pictures more on the "images" page) letting him see beauty in himself. This went on for a year of me getting him away from other users so he would not yell down the microphone at people so we could "get that temporary surgery to be a permanent surgery" but otherwise he would still be quiet bothered by the lack of full on change he wanted. 
                                    His request's were quiet ridiculous "I need to look 15 years old but with more boobs, big ass, nice tits, and dick sucking lips" which you can take that for what it is but keep in mind this man is very psychotic. I took his words with a grain of salt as he's never posed a threat to anyone young users online, nor as he done anything sexually deviant to my knowledge or the knowing of anyone else I spoke with on the VOIP application. Rather than get mad at him let's just take it as a knee in the ribs type of humor shall we.</p>
                                
                                <p>Continuing on with his antics he seems to have two other hilarious problems when you can catch him doing it, though I will present two videos evidencing his abborant behaviour when things don't go his way. Phones seem to intrigue Danster calling people from all over the world to have a "nice chat" about current happenings in his life. 
                                    To my recollection there was a time when Daniel would try to find his doctor's number while on Tinychat.com (another cam website for drunks, egirl/eboys, and NEETS to feel accepted) this resulted in him googling random doctor's numbers, dialing them, and to what I assume calling the same one everyday to get a sex change surgery. 
                                    They seemed very delighted to be called constantly more than 12 times a day by the tone of their voice. Cursing at them was an instictual habit striker had, also interrupting them constantly while they tell him "Plea-. Sir! Stop talking! P-p-please stop. SIR! STOP INTERRUPTING ME! STOP CALLING THIS DAMN OFFICE! WE DONT DO SEX CHANGE SURGERY!". 
                                    If he wasn't calling random doctor's offices he would just run his finger over the touch dial pad trying while also calling out siri to find a location of someone so he could "hack and kill them for disrespecting him [Striker]". </p>
